Here at Valhalla Gaming, We have strict rules that WILL be enforced to the fullest extent at all times!

Before you read, make sure you understand the abreviations that may be mentioned.
-------------------------
IC - In Character
OOC - Out Of Character
MG - Metagame
PG - Powergame
PM - Private Message
-------------------------
1. Role Play at all times unless your in admin jail! An adminsistrator is the only person that can declare a roleplayed even to be OOC or void a situation.

2. Do not Deathmatch, Deathmatching or DM for short is when you attack a character in anyway from vehicle to weapon to fist with out a good reason. You need a valid RP reason to attack somebody and always use common sense when debating whether or not you should attack or murder someone.
	
3. Do not Revenge kill, If you lose all of your HP and “Spawn” back at the hospital (Which is a PK; "Player Kill"), you forget everything that happened at the situation in which you got killed and you can NOT go back and harm that player or it is revenge killing.

4. Do not use hacks, cheats, or bugs. Here on MTA, We do not allow hacks, cheats, or bug exploits and if you break this rule you will be rewarded with a nice healthy permanent ban! Any bugs that you find in the server should be reported to our vG Mantis Bug tracker. Further information may be found on the forums.
	
5. This is an English speaking server! We do not tolerate any foreign languages in IC chat or OOC chat except private messages. If you want your character to learn a foreign language, try the book centers around town which will allow you to learn different languages for your character! As you hang around other people with the language you are attempting to learn, your skill will gradually increase allowing you to speak a foreign language IC through our script.

6. Do not mix IC information with OOC information! If you're mad at somebody out of character, do not take it out on them in character and vice versa. What happens in game, stays in game! :)
	
7. Do not insult or be disrespectful towards anyone in the server. The players on the server are here to have fun and have some high standard, long lasting and quality roleplay. They can't do that with people yelling at them in OOC! Respect everyone on the server! We are all here for the same reason. 
	
8. Do not RP while in admin jail. If you are punished and are sitting in admin jail, Do not RP with other players as it is an OOC punishment!

9. Do not Metagame. Metagaming is a big NO NO in this server! If you want to know something IC, figure it out from IC actions. Do NOT private message players about locations and other information that can be found out from IC.

10. Do not Powergame. Give the players some time to react in roleplay, If you fail to give others time to react and act like superman or act unrealisticly and just play to win, you will be punished. Give everybody a chance!

11. When wanting to roleplay a major situation such as robbing a bank, sniping, suicide planes and other serious events you must have permission from a lead administrator!

12. We do not tolerate forced rape in this server. If both players agree to rape OOC, it is allowed. We do not allow pedophilia on the server! No exceptions!

13. Do not rapidly press the jump key to get places faster and do not press the up arrow on your keyboard to speed up a motorcycle. Bunny hopping is unrealistic and so is the bike arrow abuse, do not do it!

14. It is against the rules to heal your self during any sort of fight. If you get shot you roleplay it, if you get beat up, role play it, if you get hurt in any way, role play it and DO NOT EAT! Eating just to regain during or after a violent RP event is unrealistic. You should go to the hospital if you want to be healed from injuries, not eat a donut.

15. Scamming people when trying to buy or sell a vehicle is forbidden. Any other sort of scam is allowed but remember to roleplay it correctly and keep it IC, no OOC scamming or influences.

16. If you're in an RP situation do not quit the game to avoid it. If your going to die or about to get caught by the police and leave the server or quit the game. The same applies with death bills, if you break this rule, you WILL be punished!

17. Do not use abbreviations IC such as smiley faces and things like "OMGWTFBBQSAUCE, LOL, WTF, ROFL or any others".

18. Nobody in real life wants to have the police after them, do not provoke the police or similar agency into chasing or going after you or you will be punished.

19. Do not transfer over ANYTHING at all from one of your characters to another one of your characters. We have perk transfers for donators! Breaking this rule will result in an immediate permenant ban.

20. You must roleplay taking out weapons and items with a /me at all times.

21. Your /me(s) must be clear and understandable. If you are going to take out a weapon, say where you are taking it out from and how you are taking the weapon out with details so it is clear. Using multi choice binds and or /me(s) such as the one that follows are not allowed. (( /me holsters/unholsters weapon.)) This is not allowed and you will be punished if you break the rule!

22. Drive like you would in real life! Here on the server we drive on the right side of the road. Don't run into walls or drive irradically for fun! If you have an IC reason to break traffic laws or drive irradically, going off road and etc, you must RP it properly.

23. If you want to start a government faction you must have permission from one of the Faction Review members!

24. Your account is yours! Keep it to your self and do not share it with others. You are responsible for the actions that are performed on your account so if you are worried your sibling or friend may do something while you are gone, log out!

25. Do not pay real life dollars for anything ingame! We do not reward people with money for donating! You need to actually roleplay for money. Also do not send private messages to people asking for things like money, vehicles and properties.

26. Characters can not have the same name as celebrities or anyone famous for that matter. Nicknames can not be a characters real name. The character's name is what is on the birth certificate! A nickname is not on the certificate. "Zollar" is a cool nickname but may not be used as an RP name for a character as it's not a valid surname or first name.

27. You can not roleplay an insane or mental character for the sole purpose of Death Matching, or breaking other rules.

28. Guns are a last resort! Do not pull a gun out with out a proper RP reason. You have your fists and /me(s) for a reason.

29. A / me must clearly show other players what you intend to do, every / me that does not clearly show other players what you're doing or trying to do (/ me holsters/unholsters his gun) is not allowed.

30. All /advertisements should be roleplayed that they were placed in either a newspaper, tv commerical, or flyers around the city. Use common sense when using /ad. Do not request or offer illegal items or services trough /ad.

31. You need admin approval to steal a vehicle.
